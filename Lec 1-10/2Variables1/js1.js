// you can change the type of a variable in js.
// it is called dynamic type Language
// c c++ java are static type language
// as in it the data type of variable is defined 
// but in js data type of variable is not defined

// literal means a const value

var a=10;
// now 10 is const . 10 is a literal
let b=20;
const c=30;
console.log(a,b,c);
